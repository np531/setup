# About
This is a collection of files and scripts that I use to setup my environment on a new installation. 
Currently only sets up my Vim keybindings (which is all I need :) ). In the future I will expand it to download basic packages and scripts that may be useful.

# Installation
1. Pull the setup script 

``$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/np531/setup/main/setup.sh``

2. Run ``./setup.sh`` to execute the setup script
 - The `-d` flag installs prereqs (supported by - Ubuntu, Arch)
 - Provide no flags just to pull the bashrc and vimrc

# Todo
 - Check/add support for distros other than ubuntu and arch
